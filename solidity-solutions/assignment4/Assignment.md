# Homework 4

You will need to use python to generate the test cases, but the goal is to write solidity code that leverages the precompiles to accomplish the following:

## Problem 1: Rational numbers

We’re going to do zero knowledge addition again.

Claim: “I know two rational numbers that add up to num/den”

Proof: ([A], [B], num, den)

```solidity
struct ECPoint {
	uint256 x;
	uint256 y;
}

function rationalAdd(ECPoint calldata A, ECPoint calldata B, uint256 num, uint256 den) public view returns (bool verified) {
	
	// return true if the prover knows two numbers that add up to num/den
}
```

Solidity/EVM has two functions you may find handy: `mulmod` (which does multiplication modulo p) and the precompile `modExp` which does modular exponentiation.

Although `modExp` does not let you raise to the power of -1, you can accomplish the same thing by raising a number to `curve_order - 2`.

The following identity will be handy:

```python
pow(a, -1, curve_order) == pow(a, curve_order - 2, curve_order)
```

(This is Fermat’s little theorem, you can ask a chatbot AI to further explain this, but it isn’t necessary to understand this)

To accomplish `pow` the precompile `modExp` may be handy.

## Problem 2: Matrix Multiplication

There is no claim statement here, just execute the math on chain.

Your contract should implement matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix (**M**) of uint256 and a n x 1 vector of points (**s**). It validates the claim that matrix **Ms = o** where o is a n x 1 matrix of uint256.

You will need to multiply **o** by the generator on-chain so that both sides have the same type.

```solidity
struct ECPoint {
	uint256 x;
	uint256 y;
[}]

function matmul(uint256[] calldata matrix,
                uint256 n, // n x n for the matrix
                ECPoint[] calldata s, // n elements
                uint256[] calldata o // n elements
               ) public returns (bool verified) {

	// revert if dimensions don't make sense or the matrices are empty

	// return true if Ms == o elementwise. You need to do n equality checks. If you're lazy, you can hardcode n to 3, but it is suggested that you do this with a for loop 
}
```

Example

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\4 & 5 & 6\\7 & 8 & 9\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}P\\Q\\R\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}P+2Q+3R\\4P+5Q+6R\\7P + 8Q + 9R\end{bmatrix}\stackrel{?}{=}\begin{bmatrix}o_1G\\o_2G\\o_3G\end{bmatrix}
$$
